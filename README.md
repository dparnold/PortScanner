# PortScanner
This is a wee test program.
The make.sh contains the bash commands for compiling the program.
As I was using Geany instead of Eclipse this seemed to be the most convenient way.
This program uses the SFML library as suggested by chrisname on cplusplus.com
You can get it by typing `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`.
